Homework 2

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file and your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

It broke the program, specifically the for loop "Base in nucleotides"
I believe this is due to the fact that by changing the variable gc_count outside of the function, the inner variable call didn't work (because it didn't have anything to call to).

Instead of breaking the entire program, the function instead just added to the Total count and printed it to the terminal.

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.43059987061138255
AT-content: 0.5694001293886175

Problem 3:

G count: 5738773
C count: 5879128
A count: 7701287
T count: 7661547

Problem 4:

The high, moderate, and small .fastq files yielded varying results, likely due to a smaller sample size (in contrast to the sample1 - sample6 files. It also looked like in each iteration of the function with a new file, the Total count and length of nucleotides was constantly the same. Although these are the same number, the len(nucleotides) function allows us to see how many are in the file under 'G', 'C', 'A', and 'T'. The sum is a result of the function adding up all of the nucleotides counted in the file.

I would use either the sum of GCAT because it doesn't count the N nucleotides, therefore it is more accurate to the actual count of total nucleotides. 

Problem 5:

AT/GC Ratio: 2.3333333333333335

Problem 6:

GC Classification: moderate GC content
