These questions are for Part 2 and assume that you've finished implementing and running analysis.py.

1. What happened to all the centroids? Why are there fewer than the 10 initial centroids?
Answer:

I believe that the centroid 0 had no/low data points, likely due to the fact
that the centroid was in a lower density datapoint area. This might have resulted in the algorithm
choosing to disclude this centroid from the final results file.

2. What's the accuracy of the algorithm for the MNIST dataset? By looking at the
centroids, which letters are easier to be distinguished by the algorithm,
and which are harder?
Answer:

The accuracy of the algorithm is 0.604. The letters of centroids 2 - 7 are the most
clear to read in my opinion. In contrast, centroids 1, 8-11 are not super clear.
