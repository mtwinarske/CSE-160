## Question 1
Why are there multiple rows for Ankh-Morpork? Why isn't there just a single row for this country?

There are multiple rows because each one represents a different measurement 
for example, the given measurements we are looking at are "farmed", "wild caught", "consumption", and "population".

## Question 2
What do you notice about the data for 1960? How do you think that affects how you'll
handle reading the data in this problem's functions? (Hint: read the tip above.)

There is no data for consumption in 1960, so the function will need to skip this missing value.

## Question 3
The consumption measurement type is clearly labeled (line 2 of the file), but none of the
other lines are labeled "production". If you were to ask "how much seafood did Ankh-Morpork 
produce in 1960?" how would you come up with the answer? (Hint: the answer would be 8098.)

Production would be a sum of both the farmed and wild caught fish and totalled up into a single value.

## Question 4
When did the US's need surpass its production?

From what I can tell, 1997 is when the US needed to surpass its production.

## Question 5
What's missing from the data we gave you that would help explain why the US was still able
to consume more seafood than it produced?

Something that would be helpful would be having some sort of Economic movement data,
like if there was an issue with production that resulted in more importing than expected.
